Thanks to `DARPA <http://www.darpa.mil/default.aspx>`_ and `Hyperion Gray LLC
<http://www.hyperiongray.com/>`_.

Thanks to all the engineers I worked with over the years who commiserated about
the hassle of managing schemas, and helped me brainstorm to find a better way.

Thanks to all the bad migrations systems I have used (and occasionally wrote
myself) that taught me *what not to do*.
