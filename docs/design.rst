Design
======

Overview
--------

The best way to understand Agnostic is to learn how it works under the hood and
the reasoning that supports its design. Both of these aspects are very simple —
I promise! The conceptual simplicity of Agnostic is one of its strong points.

.. note::

    The term `schema <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_schema>`_ is
    unfortunately overloaded by database vendors to mean different things. In
    most databases, a schema is a description of the structure of your data,
    i.e. the tables, columns, and data types. In other databases (e.g. Postgres)
    a schema is a logical grouping of objects that have shared access controls.

    To avoid confusing, we use the word "schema" in this documentation to refer
    specifically to the Postgres definition of the term. We use the terms
    "database" or "database structure" to describe the definitions of tables,
    columns, etc.

Let's quickly review the essential elements of Agnostic's design…

Pure SQL
--------

In order to truly be agnostic, as well as reduce learning curve, Agnostic
migration scripts are always written in pure SQL. You won't need to learn a new
API just to write migration scripts, and you also won't be confined by the
capabilities of that API.

Some migrations systems can convert migrations written in their native API to
pure SQL for DBAs that insist on seeing real SQL. However, like most
machine-generated code, this transliterated SQL tends to be overly complex and difficult to read. By writing migrations in SQL from the start, you can write
them to be human-readable.

Data vs. Database Structure
---------------------------

Some migration systems offer to help manage data for you. Others focus
exclusively on managing the database structure only.

Agnostic *focuses* on managing the database structure, but that does not
prohibit managing data. The "pure SQL" aspect of writing migrations means that
you can of course write DML statements to manipulate data.

Agnostic provides tools for verifying the correctness of database structure
modifications (see `Write & Test Migrations
<workflow.html#write-test-migrations>`__), but due to the innumerable
complexities of real world data, it does not attempt to verify correctness of
data modifications.

Up vs. Down
-----------

Some migration systems allow you write both "up" scripts (upgrade the database
structure) and "down" scripts (revert the database structure to an earlier
version).

In Agnostic, there is no concept of a "down" migration, for the following
reasons:

1. Allowing two scripts for each migration complicates the storage and metadata
   for migration scripts.
2. If an "up" migration discards some data, such as dropping a table, then there
   is no possible way to write a "down" migration that restores that data.
3. Despite being nominally optional, "down" scripts only work if *all
   migrations* have "down" scripts. If even a single migration lacks a "down"
   script, then there is no possibility for downgrading.
4. The need for downgrading a database structure in production is very rare; for
   those use cases where it is valuable, a backup may be faster, easier, and
   safer.

There are many limitations and caveats on "down" scripts, and in years of
development work, this author has decided that the costs far outweight any
benefits.

Storing Migrations
------------------

Migration scripts are stored in files contained within a directory of your
choosing. By convention, this directory is called ``migrations`` and Agnostic
will look for it in your current working directory, but you can choose any
directory and pass it to Agnostic with the ``--migrations-dir`` argument.

There is no prescribed layout for files within this folder; you are free to
arrange your migration scripts however you want. All you need to know are these
two rules:

    1. Migrations are named according to their relative path within the
       migration directory, without the ``.sql`` suffix.
    2. Migrations are sorted by name.

These rules are illustrated by the following example. Assume that you have the
following directory tree.

.. code::

    migrations/
        add_phone_column.sql
        drop_last_name_index.sql
        social/
            add_friends_join_table.sql
            add_favorites_column.sql
        readme.txt
        zero_balance_constraint.sql

Agnostic will scan this directory and enumerate the following migration names:

.. code::

    add_phone_column
    drop_last_name_index
    social/add_friends_join_table
    social/add_favorites_column
    zero_balance_constraint

Each migration has been named by taking its path (relative to the ``migrations``
directory) and removing the ``.sql`` suffix. Files without a ``.sql`` suffix are
ignored. The names are sorted (case sensitive) so that they will always be
applied in a deterministic order.

.. danger::

    The first rule of Agnostic migrations is:

        **You do not talk about Agnostic migrations!**

    No wait, hold up… that's the first rule of *Fight Club*. Sorry, I was
    getting really hyped up. The first rule of migrations is actually much
    tamer, but no less important:

        **Do not rename migrations after you have deployed them!**

    Migration names are used to keep track of which migrations have been applied
    and which have not been applied. (That process is described further down.)
    If you rename a migration, it will likely lead to that migration being
    applied twice, which could result in a migration failure.

    In a development environment, you'll probably be fine renaming migrations,
    as long as you and other developers know how to rebuild a database from
    scratch. But in a production environment, it's just asking for trouble.

Sample File Layout
------------------

You may now be wondering:

    *How does Agnostic manage dependencies between migrations?*

What a good looking question, fair reader!

Some migrations systems ignore this question altogether, and other systems
tackle this question by introducing complex dependency resolution — yet another
cognitive load for developers who want migrations that "just work".

**Agnostic's simple and open-ended approach allows you to manage dependencies
however you like, but without introducing a lot of extra work.**

.. note::

    You can nest directories as deeply as you want, in case you want more
    fine-grained subgroups.

The beauty of part of Agnostic is that it will automatically sort all the
migrations into the correct order: scripts for version 1.0.1 run before scripts
for version 1.2.0, which in turn run before scripts for version 2.0.0. Any
dependency conflicts between versions are automatically handled for us, with
hardly any extra work on our own part.

But what about dependency conflicts within a single version? Again, Agnostic
doesn't prescribe a single, right answer. You have a lot of options, and it's
best for your team to pick a convention that works for you and stick to it. Here
are some ideas:

1. If conflicts are related to the same feature, that might be a good hint that
   they belong in the same migration script. Try combining them into a single
   SQL script where the statements are re-ordered to solve the dependency.
2. Re-order the migrations by prefixing the file names with special characters.
   An exclamation (``!``) sorts to the top, while an at-symbol (``@``) sorts to
   the bottom.
3. If you have dozens or hundreds of migration scripts per version, then the
   special character approach may get cumbersome. Try moving the scripts that
   have dependency conflicts on each other into a subdirectory together, and
   then use special characters to reorder them within that subdirectory.

.. _metadata:

Metadata
--------

Migration metadata is stored in the same database that Agnostic is managing for
you. This arrangement is highly convenient: Agnostic already has access to this
database, and the metadata stays right next to your data. If you backup your
database, then your Agnostic metadata is backed up, too!

The metadata table looks like this:

.. code:: sql

    CREATE TABLE "agnostic_migrations" (
        name VARCHAR(255) PRIMARY KEY,
        status VARCHAR(255),
        started_at TIMESTAMP,
        completed_at TIMESTAMP
    )

We saw in a previous section how the migration name is determined (relative path, minus the ``.sql`` suffix). The status can be any of the following:

* **bootstrapped:** The migration was added to the table when the migration
  system was bootstrapped, but it was never actually executed.
* **succeeded:** The migration was successfully executed.
* **failed:** The migration failed.
* **pending:** The migration has not been executed yet, but would be executed if
  you ran the ``migrate`` command.

The ``started_at`` and ``completed_at`` columns make for a simple audit history,
so that you can see when various migrations were actually applied to a
particular system. For a more thorough explanation of **bootstrapped**, see: :ref:`build_vs_migrate`.

.. _running_migrations:

Running Migrations
------------------

Now that we know how migration files are stored on disk and how migrations are
represented in a table, we can complete the puzzle: running migrations. This is a rough outline of how migrations are executed.

1. **Make a backup, if requested.**
2. Compute pending migrations
    a. Enumerate all migration files in the migrations directory and sort them
       as described previously.
    b. Enumerate all the migrations that exist in the metadata table.
    c. The "pending" migrations are those that exist on disk but not in the
       metadata table.
3. For each pending migration:
    a. Enter the migration into the metadata table, set the status to
       ``failed``, and set the ``started_at`` time to the current time.
    b. Try to run the pending migration.
    c. If it succeeds, change the status to ``succeeded`` and set the
       ``completed_at`` time to the current time.
    d. If it fails, abort the entire process. If a backup was requested in step
       1, try to restore from that backup now.
4. **If all migrations completed successfully and a backup file was created in
   step 1, then remove that backup file.**

Note that Agnostic fails fast: an error in any single migration causes the
entire process to be aborted. In order to make this process as painless as
possible, Agnostic backs up the database before it attempts to migrate it. This
backup is automatically restored in the event of a failure.

.. note::

    If restoring from backup fails, please note that the backup file will not
    removed. It remains on disk so that you can attempt a manual recovery.

Some database systems have transactional DDL that allows Agnostic to roll back
all of the migrations in the event of a failure. Agnostic does not, however,
rely on this feature by default, for two reasons:

1. Not all DDL statements are transactional. We don't want you to think you have
   a transactional DDL safety net only to find that it's not there at that one,
   heart-thumping moment when you're migrating a major production database and
   it fails.
2. The overhead of creating a backup is negligible for small and medium sized
   datasets — no more than a few seconds.

If you are confident that you don't need this feature, and you wish to avoid the
overhead of creating a backup file, you may pass the ``--no-backup`` option to
Agnostic.

.. _build_vs_migrate:

Build vs. Migrate
-----------------

Most migration systems are part of an ORM, and most ORMs have an option to
define the database structure using a native API, then generate SQL statements
to build that database structure. This naturally leads to a difficult question:

    *How do we ensure that the build process always results in the same exact
    database structure as migrating?*

This is deceptively difficult. Small difference in database structures across
multiple instances of your application can lead to obvious, catastrophic failure
or—even worse—can lead to the ticking time bomb of slow-but-unnoticed data
corruption. This problem can reach nightmarish magnitudes if you have software
deployed on hundreds or thousands of customer sites.

**It's imperative that all deployed instances of your application have exactly
the same database structure.**

Despite the obvious need, it's not clear how best to pursue this stated goal.
One possibility is to ignore your ORM's database builder and always build new
instances solely from migrations. With this convention, your initial database
structure is treated as a "migration #1", and (along with a deterministic
migration sort order) ensures that all instances will always be built
identically.

This approach does have drawbacks, though:

1. Your ORM's database builder is part of the benefit of using an ORM! You are
   creating additional work and also run the risk that the migration script you
   write doesn't perfectly match what the ORM expects.
2. It feels inefficient to have to build a *brand new database structure* by
   building a series of old, crufty database structures first.

The other approach is to try to maintain your ORM database structure and
migrations in parallel, hoping, praying, and tediously testing to make sure that
migration scripts perfectly replicate the effect of changing your ORM models.

**Agnostic doesn't have an opinionated stance on this question.**

You are free to pick either approach, but if you decide to maintain your ORM
database structure and migrations in parallel, then Agnostic can make this
process easier and safer.

When you first bootstrap Agnostic on a given database structure, it loads all of
the existing migrations and sets their statuses to ``boostrapped`` — but it
doesn't actually execute any of them. This special status indicates that these
are migrations that already exist in the current database structure, but instead
of being put there by running migration scripts, they were put their by the
ORM's database build tool.

When Agnostic sees this status, it will know that it does not need to run these
migration scripts again. (For more information on how to do this, see: `Write &
Test Migrations <workflow.html#write-test-migrations>`__.) Once you get used to
Agnostic, you may even want to include the bootstrap step in your database build
process.

On the other hand, if you want to build all new instances from scratch purely
using migrations, then you don't want existing migrations to be bootstrapped,
because that would prevent any of them from running at all! You can disable this
behavior by passing the ``--no-load-existing`` option to the ``bootstrap``
command.
